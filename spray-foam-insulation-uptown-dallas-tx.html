<h1>Spray Foam Insulation in Uptown Dallas TX</h1>

<p>If you’re searching for <strong>spray foam insulation Uptown Dallas TX</strong>, you’re likely tired of hot upstairs rooms, A/C units that never shut off, or high summer electric bills.</p>

<p>Uptown Dallas, <strong>Oak Lawn, Turtle Creek, Knox-Henderson, and the Katy Trail area</strong> are full of townhomes, condos, and older houses that were never designed for today’s Dallas heat. Many still rely on thin fiberglass or patchy batt insulation that lets heat and humidity pour in.</p>

<h2>Why spray foam insulation fits Uptown Dallas</h2>

<p>Spray foam insulation helps Uptown properties by:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Sealing air leaks</strong> around framing, can lights, and penetrations.</li>
  <li><strong>Reducing heat transfer</strong> from the roof and exterior walls.</li>
  <li><strong>Helping A/C units cycle less</strong> and run more efficiently.</li>
  <li><strong>Stabilizing temperatures</strong> in top-floor bedrooms and lofts.</li>
  <li><strong>Improving comfort</strong> in townhomes that share walls and rooflines.</li>
</ul>

<p>Instead of just adding more fiberglass, spray foam creates a tighter thermal envelope, which is exactly what Uptown homes need in long Dallas summers.</p>

<h2>Types of spray foam used around Uptown</h2>

<p>Most spray foam insulation companies in Dallas TX use one or both of these foam types:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Open-cell spray foam</strong> – often used in attics and rooflines, great for sound and air sealing.</li>
  <li><strong>Closed-cell spray foam</strong> – denser, adds rigidity and higher R-value per inch, often used in walls, crawlspaces, or commercial areas.</li>
</ul>

<p>The right choice depends on your structure, budget, and goals. A good contractor will walk you through where each type makes sense.</p>
